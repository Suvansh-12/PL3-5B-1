            Remote working has always been around but has really come to the fore in the last 18 months with lockdowns and restrictions making many of us work from home and having to adjust our set-ups accordingly, although it may also be time to look at refreshing your home office setup. <br><br> Some of us have taken the opportunity to become digital nomads and work from different places in the world. <br><br> This flexibility provides the necessary mobility and adaptability in our workspaces and equipment to make this remote work as smooth and hassle-free as possible.
